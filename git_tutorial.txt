Git and GitHub
In a nutshell, Git is a control system for the versions of our code. By using git, we can track the progress of our projectâ€™s code and track the code changes. 
Using git, we can easily track down bugs and understand what was developed and when.

Difference between Git and GitHub
Git is the tool that tracks the changes in the code over time
GitHub is the service where we host all of our Git repositories. 
It makes it easy to work in a group with multiple people and organize the code.

Git repository
A Git repository is a folder place where our project is kept. We can access all the code associated with the project in our repository.

Basic set of commands we use to manipulate git

git clone <url> - It is used to create a copy of the git repository in our local directory.
git add <file name> - when we create a new file and we want the file to be tracked using git. We add the file using the add command
git commit - saves the files in git
git push - Upload the git commits to a remote repository like GitHub
git pull - Download the changes from the remote repo to the local machine.
git status - 
git checkout - 
git init - 

Setting up git to use in your local machine

Inorder to connect our local machine to GitHub we use an SSH key to prove to GitHub that you are the owner of your account
Download git from the following site - https://git-scm.com/downloads

Once installed open git bash and run the following commands 

To configure your name and email address in Git to be associated with your Git commits
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

To generate a ssh key locally 
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

A private (key with no extension) and a public key (key with .pub extension) will be generated and present in the .ssh folder
We need put the public key in GitHub
Copy the public key and got to GitHub -> settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH key 
Paste your key and click Add SSH key  

We need to make sure our local command line knows about this key 
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 
ls -al ~/.ssh
ssh -T git@github.com
